<h3>Conway's Game of Life simulation</h3>

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the famous mathematician John Conway in 1970.

<h3>Rules</h3>
The board is populated with cells, and on each step the board's configuration is recalculated -

1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
